# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
data = pd.read_csv("../input/spam-email/spam_email.csv")
data.head()
X = data[['address','all','our','over','order','will','free','george','semicol','paren','bracket']]

X.head()
y = data['Class']
y.head()
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

le=LabelEncoder()

y=le.fit_transform(y)
# Import train_test_split function
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split dataset into training set and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)
# Import the AdaBoost classifier
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier


# Create adaboost classifer object
abc = AdaBoostClassifier(n_estimators=50, learning_rate=1, random_state=0)

# Train Adaboost Classifer
model1 = abc.fit(X_train, y_train)


#Predict the response for test dataset
y_pred = model1.predict(X_test)
#import scikit-learn metrics module for accuracy calculation
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score


# calculate and print model accuracy
print("AdaBoost Classifier Model Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
